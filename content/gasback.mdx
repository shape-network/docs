# Gasback

Claim back 80% of the sequencer fees that users spend interacting with your contracts on Shape.

## What is Gasback?

Shape redistributes the **majority of sequencer fees spent by users to execute transactions** back to the contracts they interacted with, ensuring the creators and platforms that thrive on the network share in its success. This concept is called **Gasback**.

### I own a contract on Shape. How much gas do I get back?

All contract owners can claim back **80%** of the [L2 Fees](/building-on-shape/transaction-fees) generated from users interacting with their contracts on Shape.

### How do I take part in Gasback?

**Gasback** is open to all smart contract owners on Shape. There are two ways to register your contracts:

1. [Register via the Dashboard](/tutorials/registering-contract-gasback/dashboard)
2. [Register programmatically](/tutorials/registering-contract-gasback/programmatically)

Once registered, you'll be able to claim your share of the sequencer fees generated by your contracts' activity.
