# Getting Started with Shape

This guide will help you get started with building on Shape. Follow these steps to set up your development environment and deploy your first smart contract.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Basic knowledge of Ethereum development

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1. Install Hardhat or Foundry

Shape is compatible with popular Ethereum development frameworks like Hardhat and Foundry.

With npm:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

Or with Foundry:

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 2. Configure Your Network Settings

Add Shape network configurations to your project:

For Hardhat, add to your `hardhat.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    shape: {
      url: 'https://rpc.shape.network',
      chainId: 2231, // Shape mainnet
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
    'shape-testnet': {
      url: 'https://rpc.testnet.shape.network',
      chainId: 2232, // Shape testnet
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    },
  },
};
```

### 3. Get Testnet Tokens

To deploy contracts and interact with the Shape testnet, you'll need testnet tokens. Visit our faucet at [faucet.shape.network](https://faucet.shape.network).

## Deploying Your First Contract

### 1. Write a Simple Contract

Create a simple smart contract:

```solidity
// contracts/Greeter.sol
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Greeter {
    string private greeting;

    constructor(string memory _greeting) {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }

    function greet() public view returns (string memory) {
        return greeting;
    }

    function setGreeting(string memory _greeting) public {
        greeting = _greeting;
    }
}
```

### 2. Deploy to Shape Testnet

With Hardhat:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network shape-testnet
```

### 3. Verify Your Contract

After deploying, verify your contract on the Shape Explorer:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network shape-testnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Initial Greeting"
```

## Next Steps

Now that you've deployed your first contract on Shape, explore more advanced features:
