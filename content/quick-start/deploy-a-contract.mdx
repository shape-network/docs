# Deploy a Contract on Shape

Deploy a smart contract to Shape Sepolia and verify it on the block explorer using Foundry.

## Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed
- Shape Sepolia ETH from the [Alchemy Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/shape-sepolia)
- A wallet private key funded with testnet ETH

## 1. Create a Project

```bash
forge init my-shape-contract
cd my-shape-contract
```

This scaffolds a project with a `Counter.sol` contract in `src/`.

## 2. Deploy

```bash
forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.shape.network \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

Save the `Deployed to` address from the output.

## 3. Verify on the Explorer

```bash
forge verify-contract <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS> src/Counter.sol:Counter \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url https://explorer-sepolia.shape.network/api/
```

Replace `<DEPLOYED_ADDRESS>` with the address from step 2.

## 4. Deploy to Mainnet

When ready for mainnet, use the mainnet RPC and verify against the mainnet explorer:

```bash
forge create src/Counter.sol:Counter \
  --rpc-url https://mainnet.shape.network \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

```bash
forge verify-contract <DEPLOYED_ADDRESS> src/Counter.sol:Counter \
  --verifier blockscout \
  --verifier-url https://shapescan.xyz/api/
```

## 5. Register for Gasback

Gasback returns 80% of sequencer fees to contract owners. Register your deployed contract to start earning.
