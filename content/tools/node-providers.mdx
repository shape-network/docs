# Node Providers

RPC endpoints for reading onchain data and submitting transactions on Shape.

| Provider | Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public RPC | `https://mainnet.shape.network` | Rate-limited, suitable for development |
| Alchemy | `https://shape-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY` | Higher limits, WebSocket, enhanced APIs |

For Shape Sepolia, use `https://sepolia.shape.network` (public) or `https://shape-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY` (Alchemy).

WebSocket: `wss://shape-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY`

For production apps, use Alchemy for reliability and access to enhanced APIs (NFT, Token, Webhooks). [Free tier available](https://www.alchemy.com/rpc/shape).
