# Account Abstraction

import { AccountAbstractionCards } from '@components/cards';

Account abstraction lets you build UX where users don't need to manage seed phrases or pay gas directly. On Shape, combine AA with [Gasback](/gasback) to subsidize your users and recoup 80% of gas costs.

| Tool | Use case |
| --- | --- |
| Alchemy Bundler + Gas Manager | Full AA stack: bundled UserOps, gas sponsorship |
| Alchemy Embedded Accounts | Email/social login, no seed phrase |
| Alchemy Smart Accounts | Programmable accounts with custom validation |
| Crossmint NFT Checkout | Credit card NFT purchases, no wallet needed |
| Crossmint WaaS | Invisible wallets embedded in your app |

See [Alchemy's AA overview](https://www.alchemy.com/learn/account-abstraction) for a deeper explanation.
