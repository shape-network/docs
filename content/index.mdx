# Welcome to the Shape Docs

Shape is the chain for creators, built on top of Ethereum.

The network is an open space where everyone is free to create whatever they want - from fine art, to weird experiments, to whole new ideas - making it the place for culture to take root.

## Why create on Shape?

## The best of Ethereum.

Shape is **EVM equivalent**. This means your creator experience is the same as on Ethereum, just at a fraction of the cost.

## Secure, stable & scalable.

Shape inherits its security directly from Ethereum, keeping the networks intrinsically linked forever.

Shape also prioritizes stability and scalability, utilizing **Alchemy** and **Optimism** as key infrastructure partners to help achieve and maintain these states.

## Shape the Superchain.

Shape is a member of the **Superchain**, which unlocks a range of further benefits for the entire ecosystem - including ongoing network-level cooperation, funding of public goods, and additional builder incentives on Shape.
