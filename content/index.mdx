# Welcome

Shape is the culture-first L2 built on top of Ethereum to power the new NFT economy.

The network is an open space where everyone is free to create whatever they want - from fine art, to weird experiments, to whole new ideas - making it the place for culture to take root.

## Why create on Shape?

### Shape Culture. Get Gasback.

As a creator on Shape, you can claim back 80% of sequencer fees users spend interacting with your contracts. This includes contracts you build yourself, contracts you acquire ownership of, and contracts that you deploy through other platforms.

### The best of Ethereum.

Shape is [EVM equivalent](/building-on-shape/differences-ethereum-shape). This means your creator experience is the same as on Ethereum, just at a fraction of the cost.

### Secure, stable & scalable.

Shape inherits its security directly from Ethereum, keeping the networks intrinsically linked forever.

Shape also prioritizes stability and scalability, utilizing [Alchemy](/building-on-shape/alchemy-api) and [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) as key infrastructure partners to help achieve and maintain these states.

### Shape the Superchain.

Shape is a member of the [Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer), which unlocks a range of further benefits for the entire ecosystem - including ongoing network-level cooperation, funding of public goods, and additional builder incentives on Shape.

### Home for unique NFT experiments

Shape is the proof that NFTs aren't just static images that people can buy and sell.
