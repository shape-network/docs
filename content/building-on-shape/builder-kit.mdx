# Shape Builder Kit for Developers

The Shape Builder Kit is your go-to starter for crafting dApps on the Shape ecosystem. It&apos;s a monorepo with a Next.js frontend (wagmi, viem) and a Hardhat smart contract package, all pre-wired with sensible defaults.

- **Batteries Included**: Wallet connection, Shape RPC integration, and NFT fetching out of the box. No reinventing the wheel.
- **AI-Ready**: Pairs seamlessly with the [Shape MCP server](/building-on-shape/ai) and Vercel AI SDK for agentic apps.
- **Fast Track to Deploy**: Built for Vercel, so you can deploy to prod in minutes and focus on getting your first users!

It&apos;s completely open and composable: use it to kickstart, then tweak to your style & needs. Check it out: [github.com/shape-network/builder-kit](https://github.com/shape-network/builder-kit).

## Quickstart with `create-shape-app`

The fastest way to get started is [`create-shape-app`](https://github.com/shape-network/create-shape-app), a CLI that scaffolds a new project from the latest Builder Kit release. One command and you&apos;re in:

```bash
npx create-shape-app my-app
# or
bun create shape-app my-app
```

Also works with pnpm and yarn:

```bash
pnpm dlx create-shape-app my-app
yarn create shape-app my-app
```

The CLI will download the latest Builder Kit release, install dependencies, and initialize a git repository.

### CLI Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-y, --yes` | Skip interactive confirmation prompts |
| `--pm <bun\|npm\|pnpm\|yarn>` | Select package manager (auto-detected if omitted) |
| `--skip-install` | Skip dependency installation |
| `--skip-git` | Skip git init and initial commit |
| `--template-ref <tag>` | Pin a specific Builder Kit release tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`) |

## Project Structure

The scaffolded project is a monorepo with two packages:

```
my-app/
├── apps/web/          # Next.js + wagmi frontend
└── packages/contract/ # Hardhat smart contracts
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY=your-alchemy-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11011            # 11011 for Shape Sepolia, 360 for Shape Mainnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID= # Optional
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=                  # For contract deployment, must be funded on target network
```

Get an Alchemy API key from the [Alchemy Dashboard](https://www.alchemy.com/dashboard).

## Development

```bash
bun dev              # Run the web app locally
bun build            # Build for production
bun lint             # Lint
bun type-check       # Type-check
```

### Smart Contracts

```bash
bun contracts:compile              # Compile contracts and regenerate artifacts
bun contracts:test                 # Run contract tests
bun contracts:deploy:shape-sepolia # Deploy to Shape Sepolia
bun contracts:artifact             # Regenerate deployment artifacts for the web app
bun wagmi:generate                 # Regenerate wagmi typed ABI hooks
```

## What&apos;s Included?

- **Wallet Connection**: wagmi for MetaMask (or other wallet providers) integration. Connect with one click.
- **Shape RPC**: Pre-configured with Shape&apos;s RPC via Alchemy. Swap to your own node in `.env`.
- **Smart Contracts**: Hardhat setup with a sample `HelloShape` contract, deployment scripts, and typed wagmi hooks generated from your ABIs.
- **UI Components**: Based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) & Tailwind CSS, customize to your heart&apos;s content.
- **AI-Ready**: Pairs with the [Shape MCP server](/building-on-shape/ai) and Vercel AI SDK for agentic apps.

## Deploy to Vercel

Push to GitHub, import to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new), set env vars in the UI, and deploy. Instant live app!
