# Registering via the Dashboard

This tutorial will guide you through the process of registering your smart contract for gasback using the Gasback Dashboard UI.

## Prerequisites

1. Your smart contract must be deployed on Shape.
2. You need access to a Web3 wallet (like MetaMask) with the account that owns the smart contract you want to register.
3. Your smart contract must have an owner() function which returns the address of the account you will connect to the dashboard

## Step 1: Access the Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to the [Gasback dashboard](https://gasback.shape.network/).

## Step 6: Verify Registration

1. After the transaction is confirmed, the dashboard should update to reflect your newly registered contract.
2. You did it! You should see your unique gasback NFT that was generated onchain. The art on your NFT will evolve as your token accrues gasback.

## Step 7: Managing Your Gasback

Your dashboard will now display any gasback activity related to your registered contract. Activity can take up to 10 minutes to show up here. Registration itself earns you gasback, so you've already started your journey!

If you have more contracts you want to register for Gasback, you can click the “manage” button and add their contract addresses to the field, and all the gasback earned by those contracts will be claimable with a single NFT.
