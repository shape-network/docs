# Shape Network Documentation

> Shape is a culture-first EVM-compatible L2 built on Ethereum and the Optimism Superchain. It returns 80% of sequencer fees to contract owners via Gasback. Chain ID: 360 (mainnet), 11011 (testnet). Currency: ETH. RPC: https://mainnet.shape.network

## Getting Started

- [Getting Started](https://docs.shape.network/getting-started): Add Shape to your wallet, bridge ETH, mint your Stack
- [Gasback](https://docs.shape.network/gasback): Claim back 80% of L2 sequencer fees users spend interacting with your contracts
- [The Stack](https://docs.shape.network/the-stack): Dynamic NFT reputation system with bronze, silver, gold, and special medals
